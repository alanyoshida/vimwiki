== Basic Snippets ==

=== Execute a Script: ===
Executes a script, make sure to define the correct location of the sqf file.

*Local execution:*
{{{
  nul=execVM "scripts\test.sqf";
}}}

*Global execution:*
{{{
  [] remoteExec ["scripts\bluh.sqf", 0, false];
}}}

=== Delete a Object: ===
Can be used to delete objects place, variable name defines the name of the object.

*One Object*
{{{
deleteVehicle obj1;
}}}

*Multiple Objects*
{{{
{deleteVehicle _x} ForEach [obj1,obj2,obj3];
}}}

=== Hide/Unhide a Object: ===
Hides and unhides a already placed object. (true = hides it, false = unhides it)
{{{
objectname hideObject false;
}}}

=== Add a AddAction: ===
Gives a scrollable action on a object/Ai, text color is done via HTML colors & "this" can be set to be a object's variable name instead.
{{{
this addAction ["<t color='#FFFFFF'>Example Text</t>", "scripts\wall.sqf"];
}}}

Better add action: (Courtesy of a friend)
{{{
this addAction ["Call Artillery","scripts\arty.sqf",nil,1.5,false,true,"","",3,false,"",""];
}}}

=== Disable Ai Functions: ===
If placed directly on ai then use "this" otherwise use the variable name, prevents a Ai from doing the defined action.
this disableAI "PutActionHere";

- "TARGET" - stop the unit to watch the assigned target / group commander may not assign targets.
- "AUTOTARGET" - prevent the unit from assigning a target independently and watching unknown objects.
- "MOVE" - disable the AI's movement. (Allows it to still move it's head & body but not move)
- "ANIM" - disable ability of AI to change animation.
- "TEAMSWITCH" - AI disabled because of Team Switch.
- "WEAPONAIM" - no weapon aiming.
- "AIMINGERROR" - prevents AI's aiming from being distracted by its shooting, moving, turning, reloading, hit, injury, fatigue, etc.
- "SUPPRESSION" - prevents AI from being suppressed.
- "CHECKVISIBLE" - disables visibility raycasts.
- "COVER" - disables usage of cover positions by the AI.
- "AUTOCOMBAT" - disables autonomous switching to COMBAT when in danger.
- "PATH" - stops the AI’s movement but not the target alignment.
- "MINEDETECTION" - disable Ai mine detection.
- "ALL" - all of the above. (At this point you might as well turn off Simulation in Eden)

=== Local Hint: ===
This will give a hint in the top right of the screen but only to the person who triggers the script.
{{{
Hint "Write here";
}}}

=== Global Hint: ===
Will trigger for everyone, should be executed in a script/sqf file.
{{{
_textOne = "<t color='#E22020'>I am a script, everyone can see me.</t>";
hint parseText (_textOne);
}}}

=== Screen fading with Text: ===
Can be done in the following ways: “BLACK OUT”, “BLACK IN”, “BLACK FADED”, “BLACK”, “WHITE OUT”, “WHITE IN”.
{{{
titleCut ["I like text","BLACK IN",2.5];
}}}

=== Screen Text: ===
Adds text on your screen.

*Bottom middle (Small):*
{{{
["I like text.","plain down"];
}}}

*Middle (Big):*
{{{
["I like text",-1,-1,4,1,0,789] spawn BIS_fnc_dynamicText;
}}}

=== Image Hint: ===
This shows a image in a hint, I would advise a paa image.
{{{
hint parseText "<img image='images\image.paa' <img size='20' /> ";
}}}

=== Trigger only activating if object is alive: ===
This is set as a trigger condition, and the trigger will only fire once x object(s) are not longer existing/dead.

*One Object:*
{{{
!alive "object name"
}}}

*Multiple Objects:*
{{{
!(alive obj1) && !(alive obj2)
}}}

=== Trigger only activating on specific players: ===
Otherwise known as "thisList", can be done with one and multiple.

*One player*
{{{
PlayerVariableName in thislist;
}}}

*Multiple objects*
{{{
unit1 in thisList AND unit2 in thisList
}}}

=== Auto Bar Gate Opener: ===
Put a trigger over the bar gate, pref 3x7 square, set the the trigger to activate repeatedly and who you want to trigger it.

*On Activation:*
{{{
GateName animate ["Door_1_rot", 1]
}}}

*On Deactivation:*
{{{
GateName animate ["Door_1_rot", 0]
}}}

=== Create a big explosion on a map marker. ===
This spawns said explosive and detonates it on the marker. Should technically work with anything from
HERE[community.bistudio.com].
{{{
scriptedCharge = "Bo_Mk82_MI08" createVehicle (getMarkerPos "bombmrk");
}}}

=== Create markers on the map via a script: ===
Creates a marker on the map, ensure you have a AI the variable name set, in my case it's "bob".

*Icon Marker:*
{{{
bob = createMarker ["nameofmarker", [5150,5031]];
bob setMarkerShape "ICON";
"nameofmarker" setMarkerType "mil_objective";
"nameofmarker" setMarkerColor "ColorRed";
"nameofmarker" setMarkerDir 90;
"nameofmarker" setMarkerText "ThisIsTheMarkersName";
}}}

*Area Marker:*
{{{
bob = createMarker ["nameofmarker", [5098,5071]];
bob setMarkerShape "ELLIPSE";
"nameofmarker" setMarkerColor "ColorBlack";
"nameofmarker" setMarkerSize [100, 100];
"nameofmarker" setMarkerBrush "SOLID";
}}}

=== Delete a Map Marker: ===
This deleted a map marker via it's variable name.
{{{
deleteMarker "NameOfMarker";
}}}

=== 3D Audio: ===
Plays 3D audio on the given object, this one can be tricky sometimes when it comes to volume. (smallRadio = the object)
{{{
soundPath = [(str missionConfigFile), 0, -15] call BIS_fnc_trimString;
soundToPlay = soundPath + "sounds\radio_1.ogg";
playSound3D [soundToPlay, smallRadio, false, getPosASL smallRadio, 8, 1, 60];
}}}

=== Moveable Respawn: ===
Can be created on a object and will move the respawn there. (one = marker where the respawn gets moved)
{{{
this addAction["Take Respawn", {deleteMarker "respawn_west";
_respawn = createMarker ["respawn_west",(getMarkerPos "one")];
this removeAction 0;}, nil, 10, true, true, "", ""];
}}}

=== Unlimited Ammo: ===
Gives a vehicle or player unlimted ammo.
{{{
this addEventHandler ["Fired",{(_this select 0) setVehicleAmmo 1}];
}}}

=== Unlimted Ammo with delay: ===
40 in this case is how often it triggers the rearm. (Seconds)
{{{
nul = this spawn { while {alive _this} do { _this setVehicleAmmo 1; sleep 40 } };
}}}

=== Change texture on a flag: ===
This can be done in both jpg or paa. (1024x512 generally works)
{{{
this SetFlagTexture "images\imagename.jpg";
}}}

=== Set Damage: ===
1 = destroyed/dead
{{{
this setdammage 0.5;
}}}

=== No Surrender: ===
Forces a AI to fight, aka doesnt allow it to flee.
{{{
this allowFleeing 0;
}}}

=== Disable/Enable Damage: ===
Can be done easily in Eden, but you never know when you need this.
{{{
this allowdammage True/False;
}}}

=== Turn On/Off lights on vehicle. ===
Turns on and off the lights of a vehicle.
{{{
this Switchlight true/false;
}}}

=== Earthquake: ===
Triggers a Earthquake:
{{{
[1] call BIS_fnc_earthquake;
}}}

=== Skip time: ===
Skips x hours.
{{{
skipTime 4;
}}}

=== Engine On/Off: ===
Turn on or off a engine.
{{{
vehicleName engineOn false/true;
}}}
